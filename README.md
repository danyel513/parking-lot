# Automated Parking System

SIMULATION: https://wokwi.com/projects/394498647535481857

An Automated Parking System implemented using Arduino, which detects and manages vehicle access to a parking area. The system utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of vehicles at both entry and exit points, controlling a servo motor to open and close the entry gate accordingly.

Features

Vehicle Detection: Ultrasonic sensors placed strategically at entry and exit points accurately detect the presence of vehicles.
Dynamic Gate Control: The servo motor-controlled gate opens automatically upon detecting an approaching vehicle, granting access to the parking area, and closes after the vehicle passes through.
Real-time Display: Utilizes an LCD screen to provide real-time information, including the number of available parking spots and status messages.
Status Indication: LED indicators provide visual feedback, signaling the system's operational status. A red LED indicates standby mode, while a green LED signifies active operation.

How It Works

Vehicle Detection: Ultrasonic sensors monitor the proximity of vehicles at both entry and exit points.
Gate Control: Upon detecting an approaching vehicle at the entry point, the gate opens automatically, allowing access.
Parking Management: The system keeps track of available parking spots. If spots are available, the gate opens; otherwise, it displays a message indicating insufficient space.
Real-time Feedback: Status messages and available parking spot information are displayed on the LCD screen for user convenience.
